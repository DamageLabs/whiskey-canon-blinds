### Phase 1: Pour & Prepare

Participants pour the recommended amount and prepare their tasting glass.

### Phase 5: Scoring

Participants score the whiskey on four categories:

| Category | Weight | What to Evaluate |
|----------|--------|------------------|
| Nose | 25% | Aroma complexity, appeal, intensity |
| Palate | 35% | Flavor profile, balance, mouthfeel |
| Finish | 25% | Length, evolution, pleasantness |
| Overall | 15% | Personal enjoyment |

*Note: Scores are hidden from other participants until the reveal.*

### Phase 6: Palate Reset

Between whiskeys, cleanse your palate with water or plain crackers.

## 6. The Reveal

The host controls the reveal, building suspense by revealing whiskeys one at a time.

### Partial Reveal

The host can reveal whiskeys individually, showing:

- Whiskey identity (name, distillery, age, proof, price)
- Average scores across all participants
- Category breakdown (nose, palate, finish, overall)

![Reveal - Partial](screenshots/reveal-partial-host.png)

### Complete Reveal

After all whiskeys are revealed, the winner is displayed with a highlight.

## Host Controls

Throughout the session, hosts have access to controls:

- **Advance Phase** - Move to the next tasting phase
- **Skip to Next Whiskey** - Jump to the next sample
- **Pause** - Temporarily pause the session
- **End Session** - Terminate the session early
- **Reveal Results** - Initiate the reveal

---

## Tips for Hosts

1. **Prepare in advance** - Have all whiskeys ready and labeled with numbers only
2. **Use consistent glassware** - Glencairn glasses work well
3. **Control the pace** - Give participants enough time for each phase
4. **Build suspense** - Reveal whiskeys one at a time for dramatic effect
5. **Discuss after reveal** - Share thoughts once identities are known
